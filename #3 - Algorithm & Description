Fleury's Algorithm (Eulerian Circuit) - Description

Using given starting location by the user, the algorithm to proceed along the list of connected edges,
with the priority of the chosen edge to be lowest for a bridge. It will then change the starting variables
to reflect the new starting vertex and the edge is added to the current trail and continue in the loop, with 
the bridge priority remaining the lowest. At the end of the transition, the original edge is "deleted" from 
the graph, which is reflected by the remaining number of edges. This is continued until the starting point 
has been reached.
