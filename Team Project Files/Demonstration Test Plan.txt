Write a "Demonstration Test Plan" which lists what the user will choose when running the program, and the requirements are:
•	test EVERY USER OPTION
•	list the order ot testing
•	determine what the user will enter at each stage and TYPE IT INTO A DOCUMENT that you print (will TURN IN as part of your DEMONSTRATION TEST PLAN)
•	be prepared to step through the code when running (using a debugger) to show how it's working
•	be sure to demonstrate what happens if the user enter invalid data
